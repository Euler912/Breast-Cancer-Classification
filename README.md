# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This project uses a Kaggle dataset for binary classification to determine whether a patient has cancer or not.

The dataset is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

The goal of this project is to explore the data and build a machine learning model that classifies tumors as **malignant** or **benign**.
